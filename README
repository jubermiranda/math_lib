# **MathLib: C++ Math Library**

## **Overview**

**MathLib** is a C++ math library that implements fundamental concepts from linear algebra, analytic geometry, and other related topics. Its purpose is to provide a set of tools for learning and practical application of these concepts, while also serving as a solid base for experimenting with new mathematical techniques and C++ development.

This library was initially conceived as part of my studies at university, covering subjects such as:

- **Linear Algebra**
- **Analytic Geometry**
- *(Other subjects may be added in the future)*

The library also serves as a resource to develop my skills in **C++** and **object-oriented programming**.

## **Features**

- Matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transposition)
- Matrix classification
- Determinant calculation

> More features will be added as new concepts are studied and applied.

## **Building and Running Tests (Linux)**

### **Prerequisites**

- **C++11** or later
- **CMake** (optional, but recommended)
- **Google Test** (for unit tests)

### **Cloning the Repository**

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jubermiranda/math_lib
cd math_lib
```

### **Compiling the Tests**

1. **Create a build directory**:

```bash
mkdir .build
```

2. **Generate the build files** using CMake:

```bash
cmake -S . -B .build/
```

3. **Build the test executable**:

```bash
cmake --build .build/
```

### **Running the Tests**

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
.build/tests/./test_matrix_lib
```

If all tests pass successfully, you'll see a summary of the results in your terminal.
